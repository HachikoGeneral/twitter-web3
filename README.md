 A twitter decentralized application (dapp) where users can upload posts to the __network__ as well as mint their own profile image as __NFT__.
 
 NFT images have a unique hexagon shape.

 In depth we are:

  - Building a Web 3.0 Application with __Next JS__.

  - Creating, auditing and deploying our smart contract using __Solidity__.

  - Styling our app with __Tailwind CSS__.

  - Adding __Web 3.0__ authentication using __MetaMask__.

  - Storing the tweets in __Sanity.io__.

  - __Mint__ our own __NFT profile picture__ and store it on __Pinata__.

  - Deploy and host the app on __Vercel__.
